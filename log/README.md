# Log Files

This folder will have log files that are created with each session of wazigate-edge (every time the application starts). You can delete old files but not the log file that is currently in use by a running wazigate-edge instance, as the file is opened for writing.

Sorting the files by name will also sort by date, as the names are generated from the current date as they are created.
